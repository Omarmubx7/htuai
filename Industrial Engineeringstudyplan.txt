Industry 4.0 followed by considering possible future directions with respect to  
Industry 5.0 – personalisation. 
 
Research Project for IE 
This course introduces the skills necessary to deliver a complex, 
independently conducted research  project that fits within an industrial 
engineering context. Topics included in this course are: Finding a research 
problem, project proposal, selection of project approach, literature review, 
 
data analysis and interpreting findings, project management and key 
milestones, reporting the research, project oral  presentation, and research 
publication methods. 
 
Capstone Project for IE 
This course focuses on how choose and refine capstone project based on 
feedback from faculty, peers and partner organizations. It introduces 
technical methods for analyzing, designing, prototyping,  synthesizing, 
troubleshooting, and testing a project relevant to industrial engineering. 
The students  practice project documentation, formal design review 
presentations, oral defense of the project, and writing a final report. 
Presents various guest speakers from different IE fields and industries to open 
the door for possibilities. 
 
Decision Analysis and Strategy 
 
This course focuses on applying quantitative methods and decision -
making techniques to real -world industrial problems. The course covers 
topics such as optimization, linear and integer programming, simulation, 
game theory, and heuristics. Students will learn how to gather and analyze 
data, build models, and make informed decisions to improve processes and 
increase efficiency in industrial settings. Additionally, students will 
explore various strategy formulation and implementation techniques, 
including SWOT analysis, Porter's Five Forces, and strategic management 
frameworks. The goal of the course is to equip students with the analytical 
and strategic skills necessary to be effective leaders and decision -makers 
in industrial engineering. 
 
 
 
IE PROGRAM ELECTIVES 
 
Manufacturing Process 
This course introduces the students to the techniques and capabilities of different 
manufacturing processes for metals and polymers. Fundamental topics include 
Manufacturing processes (cutting, casting, forming, machining, joining, finishing, 
 
assembly, additive manufacturing etc.), dimensional measurements, quality 
engineering, design for manufacturing, production planning. 
 
Industrial Robotics 
The aim of this course is for students to investigate the range, operations, and 
benefits of industrial robots within manufacturing applications. The course covers 
the fundamentals of robot systems, including their kinematics, dynamics, and 
control. Among the topics included are industrial robot selection, programming and 
safety protocols that anticipate future dev elopments in industrial robot technology.  
Students will learn the different robot structures with emphasis on six -degree of 
freedom manipulators. Students will understand the electrical, mechanical, hydraulic 
and pneumatic operation of common industrial r obots. Students will learn how to 
program an industrial robot for automated process applications and will understand 
the communication protocols. Through lectures, lab experiments, and hands -on 
projects, students will learn how to design and program industrial robots for various 
applications. By the end of the course, students will have a strong foundation in 
industrial robots and automation systems, enabling them to develop and implement 
robotic solutions in real-world settings. 
Discrete Event Simulation 
This course provides an in -depth introduction to discrete event simulation, a 
powerful analytical tool essential for studying complex industrial systems. 
Through a combination of theory and practical application, students will 
develop the skills necessary to effectively model, simulate, and analyze 
various systems. Key topics covered in the course include Input/output 
analysis, random number generation, Queuing models, and model validation 
and verification. The “theory” of simulation involves probability and statistics, 
thus a good background in probability and statistics is required. The “theory” 
of simulation involves probability and statistics, thus a good background in 
probability and statistics is required. Throughout the course, emphasis will be 
placed on practical application, hands -on exercises, and case studies to 
reinforce theoretical concepts and develop students' proficiency in simulation 
modeling and analysis. By the end of the course, students will be equipped 
with the skills and knowledge necessary to leverage discrete event simulation 
effectively in the study and optimization of complex industrial systems. 
Digital Transformation 
 
In this unit, students will explore the impact of both the current and emerging digital 
technologies across different industries and investigate how organisations and  
businesses use digital technologies to meet their needs. They will also look at how 
an organisations strategy and leadership decision making is impacted by digital  
technology implementation. They will plan a solution for a specific organisation to 
use a new or emerging technology. 
 
Maintenance Engineering 
This course introduces the concepts of Reliability, maintainability, availability, and 
safety of products and systems, with practical applications and case studies. Topics 
covered include: Building and analyzing reliability models using block diagrams, 
Fault Tree Analysis (FTA), Failure Mode & Effect Analysis (FMEA), concepts 
and methods of maintenance planning and management with a focus on corrective 
and preventive maintenance, cost estimation and scheduling of maintenance 
activities, forecasting of spare parts needed for equipment maintenance, inventory 
control models, introduction to computerized maintenance management systems. 
 
Ergonomics 
Basic concepts of anthropometry, to match the physical dimensions of workplaces 
and products with the body dimensions of intended users;  An introduction to 
occupational biomechanics, the structure and properties of the musculoskeletal 
system, and related upper extremity related cumulative trauma disorders;  
Physiological aspects of muscle work and the implications of work capacity limits 
for ergonomic job design;  Nature of light stimulus, eyeball anatomy and 
characteristics of the visual sensory system; Human information processing model, 
cognition processes, limitations of the human cognitive system, implications and 
solutions for design problems;  Human factors principles in the design of displays 
and controls.
