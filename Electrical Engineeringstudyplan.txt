30301120: Pre-Foundation English Elementary Intensive + Lab, 4 Cr (6,3) 
This foundation course deals with all language skills: speaking, listening, reading, writing, grammar review, 
and vocabulary building. The overall objective of the course is to ensure that students will be able to 
understand straightforward information in the spoken and written language and to express themselves in 
speech and in writing for simple practical purposes in everyday situations requiring a simple and direct 
exchange of information. 
By the end of the course, students will reach an A2 level on the Global Scale of English (GSE). Students 
will be evaluated on their ability to understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas 
of most immediate relevance. Students will be able to describe in simple terms aspects of their background, 
immediate environment, and matters in areas of immediate need.  
This course also includes scheduled lab time, dedicated to practice and/or other work assigned by the 
instructor to enhance students’ communication skills [including assigned homework/in-class practice], 
writing or speaking workshops, and projects. 
Prerequisites: Placement test score: Pearson 0-35, VTEST A1, A2.1, A2.2 (0-34), TOEFL IBT: 0-31, IELTS: 0-
4.0, TOEFL ITP: 0-399 
 
30301121: Pre-Intermediate English Intensive + Lab, 4 Cr (6,3) 
This foundation course deals with all language skills: speaking, listening, reading, writing, grammar review, 
and vocabulary development. The overall objective of the course is to ensure that students could understand 
and express in speech and writing: information, ideas, feelings, opinions, and common functions about 
situations relating to English skills.  
By the end of the course, students will reach a B1 level on the Global Scale of English (GSE). Students will 
be evaluated on their ability to understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters 
regularly encountered in the typical work-related environment/setting, specifically in relation to technical-
English related communication skills. In addition, students are required to be able to deal with most 
situations likely to arise while at the workplace or in the field where English is spoken; in addition to the 
type of setting they would need to communicate to other stakeholders (customer/ client, supervisor, 
sponsor/funding entity/ supplier and so on). Students will be able to produce simple connected text on topics 
which are familiar in their field of study, and in relation to basic communication skills needed. Finally, 
students will be able to describe experiences and work-related skills, their opinion, plans, and other 
practical, relevant communication skills.  
This course also includes a scheduled lab time, dedicated to practice and/or other work assigned by the 
instructor to enhance students’ communication skills [including assigned homework/in-class practice], 
writing or speaking workshops, and projects pertaining.

Prerequisites: Placement test score: Pearson 36-46, VTEST B1.1 (35-45), TOEFL IBT: 32-42 (Minimum score 
of 6 in each of the four sections), IELTS: 4.5 (Minimum score of 4.0 in each of the four sections), TOEFL ITP: 
400-442, or 30301120 
 
30301122: English Intermediate, 3 Cr (6,0) 
This course is meant to follow on from 30301121; it is for students who have completed level 2 and now 
require an intermediate course in Technical English, and it is benchmarked against CEFR level B1+. This 
course targets students in technical or vocational education who want to develop their careers and technical 
skills, as it aims to prepare them for the successful and effective use of English in their studies and 
occupations.  
The course adopts a practical task-based approach, consisting of work-specific communicative functions, 
technology-specific notions or concepts, grammar, vocabulary, and skills. The syllabus is designed to 
reflect current and future developments in technology, whereby everything is selected based on high 
frequency of use and relevancy of needs across a range of technical contexts, including technical training 
and work contexts. 
Prerequisites: Placement test score: Pearson 47-58, VTEST B1.2 (46-55), TOEFL IBT: 43-52 (Minimum score 
of 10 in each of the four sections), IELTS: 5.0 (Minimum score of 4.5 in each of the four sections) 
TOEFL ITP: 443-476, or 30301121 
 
30301123: English Upper-Intermediate, 3 Cr (6,0) 
This course is for students in technical or vocational education, and for company employees in training at 
work. It covers the core language and skills that students need to communicate successfully in all technical 
and industrial specializations. It is for students who have an intermediate level of general English and now 
require an upper intermediate course in English for specific purposes. This is benchmarked against CEF 
level B2.  
The course uses a multi-thread syllabus consisting mainly of communicative functions, notions, grammar, 
vocabulary, and skills. The work-specific communicative functions (e.g., giving instructions, making 
recommendations') and technology-specific notions or concepts (e.g., causation, resistance) are selected on 
the basis of relevance to the needs of students in technical training and work contexts. Grammatical 
exponents of functions and notions are selected based on frequency and relevance to needs. In this level, 
the syllabus organization is increasingly driven by topics, skills and genre or text type, within which 
appropriate grammar, vocabulary, functions, and notions are introduced or recycled. The vocabulary of the 
course is a selection of common core lexical items that have a high frequency of use across a range of 
technical and industrial contexts. Many of these items can be found in general contexts but have a greater 
frequency and often a more specific meaning in technical contexts. Many of them are the kind of words 
which a specialist in one field might use to explain technical concepts and specialized terms to the public, 
or to specialists in other fields. 
Prerequisites: Placement test score: Pearson 59-68, VTEST: B2.1 (56-68), TOEFL IBT: 53-78 (Minimum score 
of 14 in each of the four sections), IELTS: 5.5-6.0 (Minimum score of 5.0 in each of the four sections), TOEFL 
ITP: 477-547, or 30301122

30301124: English Advanced Course, 3 Cr (6,0) 
This course is meant to follow 30301123. This course deals with all language skills: speaking, listening, 
reading, writing, grammar review, and vocabulary building. The overall objective of the course is to ensure 
that students can understand and respond appropriately in the spoken and written form to a wide range of 
demanding, longer texts and recognize implicit meaning.
