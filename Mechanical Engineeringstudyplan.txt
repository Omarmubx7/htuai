Assessment of Program Outcomes 
Assessment model requires the students to engage with a variety of assessment tools that are 
accessible, appropriately challenging, and support the development of student self -efficacy and self-
confidence. To ensure that assignments are valid and reliable, a robust quality assurance system that 
measures and monitors the effectiveness of their implementation is adopted. This includes ensuring 
that all students engage in assessment positively and honestly. Assessment also provides a learning 
opportunity for all stakeholders of the assess ment to have access to feedback that is both individual 
to each student and holistic to the cohort. Feedback to students should be supportive and 
constructive. Student self -efficacy (and therefore self -confidence) can be significantly enhanced 
where feedback not only focuses on areas for improvement but recognizes the strengths a student 
has. At the cohort level, similar trends could be identified that could inform future approaches to 
assessments and teaching.

benchmarked against CEF level B2.  
The course uses a multi -thread syllabus consisting mainly of communicative functions, notions, 
grammar, vocabulary, and skills. The work-specific communicative functions (e.g., giving instructions, 
making recommendations') and technology -specific notions or concepts (e.g., causation, resistance) 
are selected on the basis of relevance to the needs of students in technical training and work contexts. 
Grammatical exponents of functions and notions are selected based on frequency and relevance to 
needs. In this level, the syllabus organization is increasingly driven by topics, skills and genre or text 
type, within which appropriate grammar, vocabulary, functions, and notions are introduced or 
recycled. The vocabulary of the course is a selection of common core l exical items that have a high 
frequency of use across a range of technical and industrial contexts. Many of these items can be found 
11 
 
in general contexts but have a greater frequency and often a more specific meaning in technical 
contexts. Many of them are the kind of words which a specialist in one field might use to explain 
technical concepts and specialized terms to the public, or to specialists in other fields.
