Assessment of Learning Outcomes 
Assessment model requires the students to engage with a variety of assessment tools that are accessible, 
appropriately challenging, and support the development of student self-efficacy and self-confidence. To 
ensure that assignments are valid and reliable, a robust quality assurance system that measures and 
monitor the effectiveness of their implementation is adopted. This includes ensuring that all students 
engage in assessmen t positively and honestly. Assessment also provides a learning opportunity for all 
stakeholders of the assessment to have access to feedback that is both individual to each student and 
holistic to the cohort. Feedback to students should be supportive and constructive. Student self-efficacy 
(and therefore self-confidence) can be significantly enhanced where feedback not only focuses on areas 
for improvement, but recognizes the strengths a student has. At the cohort level, similar trends could be 
identified that could inform future approaches to assessments and teaching.

vocabulary building. The overall objective of the course is to ensure that students will be able to understand 
straightforward information in the s poken and written language and to express themselves in speech and in 
writing for simple practical purposes in everyday situations requiring a simple and direct exchange of 
information. 
 By the end of the course, students will reach an A2 level on the Global Scale of English (GSE). Students will be 
evaluated on their ability to understand sentences and frequently used expressions related to areas of most 
immediate relevance. Students will be able to describe in simple terms aspects of their background, immediate 
environment, and matters in areas of immediate need.  
This course also includes a scheduled lab time, dedicated to practice and/or other work assigned by the 
instructor to enhance students’ communication skills [including assigned homework/in-class practice], writing 
or speaking workshops, and projects. 
 
Prerequisites: Placement test score: Pearson 0-35, VTEST A1, A2.1, A2.2 (0-34) TOEFL IBT: 0-31,

30301121 : Pre-Intermediate English Intensive + Lab 4 Cr (6,3) 
 
This foundation course deals with all language skills: speaking, listening, reading, writing, grammar review, and 
vocabulary development. The overall objective of the course is to ensure that students could understand and 
express in speech and writing: information, ideas, feelings, opinions, and common functions about situations 
relating to English skills. 
By the end of the course, students will reach a B1 level on the Global Scale of English ( GSE). Students will be 
evaluated on their ability to understand the main points of clear standard input on familiar matters regularly  
B encountered in the typical work -related environment/setting, specifically in relation to technical -English 
related communication skills. In addition, students are required to be able to deal with most situations likely 
to arise while at the work-place or in the field where English is spoken; in addition to the type of setting they 
would need to communicate to other stakehol ders (customer/ client, supervisor, sponsor/funding entity/ 
supplier and so on). Students will be able to produce simple connected text on topics which are familiar in 
their field of study, and in relation to basic communication skills needed. Finally, stu dents will be able to 
describe experiences and work-related skills, their opinion, plans, and other practical, relevant communication 
skills.  
This course also includes a scheduled lab time, dedicated to practice and/or other work assigned by the 
instructor to enhance students’ communication skills [including assigned homework/in-class practice], writing

30301122: English Intermediate 3 Cr (6,0) 
 
This course is meant to follow on from 30301121; it is for students who have completed level 2 and now 
require an intermediate course in Technical English, and it is benchmarked against CEFR level B1+. This course 
targets students in technical or vocational education who want to develop their careers and technical skills, as 
it aims to prepare them for the successful and effective use of English in their studies and occupations. The 
course adopts a practical task -based approach, consisting of work -specific communicative functions, 
technology-specific notions or concepts, grammar, vocabulary, and skills. The syllabus is designed to reflect 
current and future developments in technology, whereby everything is selected based on high frequency of 
use and relevancy of needs across a range of technical contexts, including technical training and work contexts.  
 
Prerequisites: Placement test score: Pearson 47-58, VTEST B1.2 (46-55), TOEFL IBT: 43-52 (Minimum score of 
10 in each of the four sections), IELTS: 5.0 (Minimum score of 4.5 in each of the four sections), TOEFL ITP: 443-
476, or 30301121 
 
 
30301123: English Upper-Intermediate 3 Cr (6,0) 
This course is for students in technical or vocational education, and for company employees in training at work. 
It covers the core language and skills that students need to communicate successfully in all technical and 
industrial specializations. It is for students who have an intermediate level of general English and now require 
an upper intermediate course in English for specific purposes. This is benchmarked against CEF level B2.  
The course uses a multi -thread syllabus consisting mainly of communicativ e functions, notions, grammar, 
vocabulary, and skills. The work -specific communicative functions (e.g., giving instructions, making 
recommendations') and technology-specific notions or concepts (e.g., causation, resistance) are selected on 
the basis of relevance to the needs of students in technical training and work contexts. Grammatical exponents 
of functions and notions are selected based on frequency and relevance to needs. In this level, the syllabus 
organization is increasingly driven by topics, skills and genre or text type, within which appropriate grammar, 
vocabulary, functions, and notions are introduced or recycled. The vocabulary of the course is a selection of 
common core lexical items that have a high frequency of use across a range of technical and industrial contexts. 
Many of these items can be found in general contexts but have a greater frequency and often a more specific 
meaning in technical contexts. Many of them are the kind of words which a specialist in one field might use to 
explain technical concepts and specialized terms to the public, or to specialists in other fields. 
 
Prerequisites: Placement test score: Pearson 59-68, VTEST: B2.1 (56-68), TOEFL IBT: 53-78 (Minimum score of 
14 in each of the four sections), IELTS: 5.5-6.0 (Minimum score of 5.0 in each of the four sections) , TOEFL ITP:
